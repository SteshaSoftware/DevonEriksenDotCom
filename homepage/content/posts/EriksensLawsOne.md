After all, a writer may be the god of the universe he creates, but he isn't the god of his readers. They are guests in his universe over whom he has no control. He can't simply dictate to them that they are interested... he must follow the principles, or rules, of what makes readers interested. These aren't under his control, they're simply based on the psychology of human beings.
