If you want to snatch a priceless alien artifact from the most heavily defended piece of sky in the outer solar system, and get away undetected, your best bet is a team of highly-experienced professionals who work together like the gears of an expensive watch.<br><br>

Or you could just send a tramp spacecraft constructed from plans found on internet, and crew it with a failed asteroid miner turned space pirate, a genetically modified - and emotionally unstable - heiress, and a prototype Artificial Intelligence in the midst of a catastrophic identity crisis.

Maybe they won’t murder each other on the way there.
