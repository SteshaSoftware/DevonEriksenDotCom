<title>You&#39;re about to go to bed, when you find a woman getting food out of your refrigerator. It turns out, that &#39;cat&#39; you picked up outside the grocery store, wasn&#39;t a cat at all. | Devon Eriksen</title>

</header><p>&ldquo;Turn around slowly, with your hands&hellip; wha&hellip; the&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have stammered too, if you saw what I saw. Somebody breaks into your house, you
expect a big scary dude, balaclava, maybe a gun. Or a crowbar for prying windows.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect was a bottom. Well, to be honest, it was more of an ass. The kind of
ass that writes its own ticket to private events, on top of exactly the pair of legs you&rsquo;d
want for sashaying it in past the velvet ropes.</p>
<p>Looked kinda out place sticking out of my refrigerator.</p>
<p>I kind of expected a response, but the owner of the butt in question didn&rsquo;t say anything.
She just kept rummaging. So I tried again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, what are you doing in my house? Second, what are you doing in my
refrigerator? And, lastly, and I&rsquo;d like to stress the importance of this one, <em>why the hell
are you naked?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; purred a melodious feminine voice from around the door, &ldquo;where else would
I be? Second, deciding between a package of hot dogs, and what looks like&hellip; leftover
shrimp linguini? Third, and I&rsquo;d think it would be obvious, because I didn&rsquo;t put any
clothes on, silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just turn around and keep your hands where I can see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would I do that? I still haven&rsquo;t decided yet. Oh, wait&hellip; is this <em>prosciutto</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m saving that for -&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! Why thank you, that was sweet of you. You totally should have!&rdquo; she said, followed
by a rustle of plastic, then chewing sounds and little moans of what sounded like
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Stand. The. Fuck. Up.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finally turned around, a full slice of Parma&rsquo;s best hanging from her lips.</p>
<p>A mop of uncombed blonde hair, almost closer to white, pale skin, delicate features.
Funny looking eyes.</p>
<p>She made no effort to cover her breasts, possibly because her hands were far too busy
cuddling the rest of the package. I tried to find a safe place to put my eyes. Not that
she seemed care much. Girl had the modesty of a cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pddd th rfle dn,&rdquo; she said, looking me straight in the eye. One blue, one green.
Heterochromia. Weird. Had the feeling I&rsquo;d seen it somewhere before. Like, recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pddd th -&rdquo; she stopped, held up an index finger, and chewed, not using her hands, just
waggling her heard around to get the rest. She did not hurry. Table manners of a cat,
too, apparently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the rifle down. What are you going to do with it, anyway, shoot me? And then explain
to the police how you were in grave and immediate danger from a small unarmed naked girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but flick my eyes down briefly. Oops. At least I didn&rsquo;t have my finger on
the trigger. I put the sling around my shoulders and let it hang over the front of my
bathrobe. She didn&rsquo;t look relieved, maybe &lsquo;cause she never looked that perturbed to begin
with. She just hopped up on the counter next to the sink, raised the package to her lips,
grabbed another slice with her teeth, and chewed, making little purring noises.</p>
<p>I just tried not to stare. Unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go back to bed,&rdquo; she said, after the next slice vanished, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t point any
more guns at me, yeah? It&rsquo;s kinda rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is breaking into people&rsquo;s houses and raiding their refrigerator!&rdquo; I snapped, &ldquo;What
did you expect me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not freak out when I get a midnight snack. Feed me better food to begin with. Oh, and
learn how to rub my tummy properly. And pull my tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the tummy in question, stretched out as she lounged full length on the
counter now, sprawled out like a cat, fishing another slice of prosciutto out of the
package with her teeth. Hmmm&hellip; flat, taut, no sixpack, but just a tiny line down the
middle hinting at one, soft smooth white skin&hellip; yeah, she&rsquo;d have no problem finding
volunteers even for a weird request like -</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your <em>tail</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I mean, don&rsquo;t yank it or anything. Just a steady pressure, then slowly increase
until you get the little joints to pop. I love that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it hit me. The eyes. The hair. The weird body language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Wait. I get it now. I get who you&rsquo;re supposed to be. You did the eyes and
everything. What are those, colored contacts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to be anybody, I&rsquo;m just me. Oh, and leave your door open at night, I
want to sleep on the bed. Are you even listening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, lady, full marks for dedication to the role. Unless you&rsquo;re, like, a stripper
or something. Who put you up to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? I was hungry, that&rsquo;s all&hellip; oh. I see. <em>Humans</em>,&rdquo; she sighed,
rolling her eyes. The contacts, now that I looked closely, had vertical slits for pupils.
Wasn&rsquo;t surprised. You can find anything on the internet.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t convinced.</p>
<p>And then I was.</p>
<p>When she <em>changed</em>, it wasn&rsquo;t like a movie werewolf, all contortions and yowling and
growing fur. She simply - blurred - as the signal scanned between the two frequencies
of &ldquo;naked girl with messy hair&rdquo; and &ldquo;white cat&rdquo;, then settled on the familiar form of
the stray I took in last Tuesday&hellip; small, a bit skinny, white fur, mismatched eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rrrrow,&rdquo; she said, presumably meaning something more complex, but I didn&rsquo;t speak cat.</p>
<p>Okay, so the world wasn&rsquo;t what I thought it was. I felt a little vertigo, but not enough
to stop me from acting quick, and snatching the what was left of the prosciutto away from
her. She scampered after me with a outraged yowl as I returned it the fridge, but she
couldn&rsquo;t change back in time to stop me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, give that back! It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it now? I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my house, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. You wandered in here a week ago. It&rsquo;s not your house, you&rsquo;re just my <em>cat</em>.
Although I have no idea how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned and leaned against the fridge, planting my back against the door. She put her
hands on her hips, still without the least effort at modesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to say,&rdquo; she sniffed, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re my human. Which means that this is <em>my</em> house,
too. And that food is in <em>my</em> house, which makes it my food, too. Come on. Don&rsquo;t make me
fight dirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked her up and down, or rather down and further down, and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure you could fight a stiff breeze. Besides, I&rsquo;m over twice your size, and
armed. What the hell are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you,&rdquo; she actually grinned back, just briefly, as she said
it.</p>
<p>And she started to cry.</p>
<p>Oh, not all at once. Widening eyes cascaded into a falling face, a wobbling lower lip, a
few artful sniffles, a sob or two&hellip; then she threw herself on the floor and clung to my
knees, bawling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleeeeeeeease, Masterrrrrrrrrrr! I&rsquo;m so <em>hungry</em>! I thought you were nice, but all you
feed me is that awful dry stuff from the bag, and it makes me feel like you don&rsquo;t love
me! Aren&rsquo;t I good enough for you? I <em>tried</em> to be a good kitty, I tried so <em>hard</em>&hellip; but
you won&rsquo;t even let me sleep on the <em>bed</em>, and you&hellip; you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The blue and green eyes stared up at me, blinking out a fountain of tears. Boring into
my soul.</p>
<p>I lasted about forty-five seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, fine, whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaaaaaay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pounced on the refrigerator door. By the time I&rsquo;d stashed the rifle behind the couch,
sat down on it heavily, and contemplated the whimsical and unexpected nature of the
universe I found myself in, tuperware and takeout cartons littered the floor of my
kitchen, and she came bouncing towards me with a small but noticeable bulge in that flat
tummy, grinning around a hairbrush from the guest bathroom.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t really seem to have much of notion what hands are for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrrrrrrrrm?&rdquo; she chirped, and didn&rsquo;t wait for me to finish my sigh and nod before she
flopped down at full length with her head in my lap. Still extremely naked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was completely fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hands, moving of themselves, began brushing tangles out of the pale silken waterfall
of her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmmmm. Yeah. So?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>knew</em> it was fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it worked on me anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did it work on me anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuz humans are pushovers. It&rsquo;s like the perfect scam. It works even when we tell you
about it. We short circuit the parts of your brain evolved for child rearing. You can
push harder, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. I can&rsquo;t stand kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have a lot of pent up urges. Perfect victim. C&rsquo;mon, harder. Scratch my scalp with
it. Our pain thresholds are higher than yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say it, of course, but the pent up urges in me at that moment had nothing to do
with child care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, how do you actually do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just act affectionate and you give me things. Ooooh, now scratch my scalp with your
fingernails, please. Fingernails are <em>awesome</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean turning into a human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that. You know the laws of physics? Well, they&rsquo;re not really laws. More like&hellip;
regulations. And cats are good at ignoring stuff like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooo, you all just treat basic biology like the rule that says you&rsquo;re not supposed to
jump up on the counter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all of us. I&rsquo;m <em>talented</em>. Aren&rsquo;t you lucky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing as I&rsquo;m now giving a scalp massage to a home invader, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure.&rdquo;</p>
